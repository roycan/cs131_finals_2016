To run our code, you need to access the src folder in the Prob6.
Then run through the command prompt.
What does the code do?
It simply computes the equations (19-21) given in the problem. 
It also uses the LU Factorization (Crout's Algorithm) that was made by Faith Therese Peña (Thank you for the code).
And it outputs the following
Y vector that is used in Ly = b
X vector in Ux=y
and the final answer T vector
